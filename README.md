## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes Applied

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ Firebase initialization failures → Fixed with explicit FirebaseOptions
- ✅ iOS deployment target too low → Updated to 13.0+
- ✅ Bundle ID mismatches → Corrected across all config files
- ✅ CocoaPods dependency conflicts → Resolved GTMSessionFetcher version
- ✅ Missing URL schemes → Added Firebase and Google auth schemes
- ✅ UI overflow on smaller screens → Responsive design improvements
